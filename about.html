                    <p>
                        Grab some fellow heroes.
                        Print off some PubQuest character sheets.
                        Grab a 20-sided die, and pencils (or dry-erase markers, if you've laminated your sheets).
                        Then head out on an adventure -- everything you need to know is printed on your character sheet!
                        PubQuest works best if the group visits multiple pubs, er, "dungeons" during the adventure.

                    <h2 style="font-family:Fondamento">What's the goal?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The overall goal is to have a fun time!
                        But the objective of PubQuest is to be the first to reach either Level 10 (easy mode) or Level 20 (hard mode).
                        You will gain and lose levels throughout the course of the game.
                        Usually, heroes must drink <i>something</i> in order to gain a level.
                        And usually, heroes that drink get drunk!

                    <h2 style="font-family:Fondamento">How complicated is it?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Only mildly complex. PubQuest was designed so heroes can continue their adventure even while drunk.
                        You'll only need to keep track of your sheet, your 20-sided die, and a pen --
                        all things that fit easily in a pocket!
                        There are only a handful of rules, and they're all printed out on each character sheet.
                        Feel free to tweak PubQuest to your heart's content; you can cross out rules or add them.

                    <h2 style="font-family:Fondamento">How do you define a drink?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In PubQuest, a drink means any of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 bottle or glass of beer</li>
                            <li>1 glass of wine</li>
                            <li>1 shot of liquor</li>
                            <li>1 cocktail</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2 style="font-family:Fondamento">Why are there different character sheets?</h2>
                    <p>
                        PubQuest was inspired by classic, fantasy roleplaying games, such as Dungeons & Dragons.
                        Therefore, each person playing PubQuest can choose what kind of hero they want to be for the night.
                        The only difference between the different character types is a special ability, which can be used once per dungeon.
                        Feel free to come up with your own characters and special abilities!

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h2 style="font-family:Fondamento">How is this different from pub golf?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pub golf is a pretty generic type of drinking game which mainly serves to guide a pub crawl.
                        Each pub along the route is a "hole," and players deduct points for drinking at each hole;
                        the player with the least points at the end of the game wins, as in golf.
                        PubQuest, on the other hand, gives players multiple things to do at each new location,
                        while having fun with a fantasy roleplaying theme.

                        Staying hydrated is important. Every hero knows that.
